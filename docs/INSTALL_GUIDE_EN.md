# Installation Guide

## macOS

### "Unidentified Developer" Warning

When you first run the app, macOS may show:

> "FaceMosaicLocal" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

**Fix:**

1. In Finder, locate `FaceMosaicLocal.app`
2. **Control + click** (or right-click) and choose **Open**
3. Click **Open** in the dialog
4. From then on, double-click will work

Alternatively: **System Settings → Privacy & Security** → find the blocked app → click **Open Anyway**.

> This app runs 100% offline and does not send any data. Source code is available on GitHub.

## Windows

### SmartScreen Warning

Windows may show a blue screen:

> Windows protected your PC – unrecognized app

**Fix:**

1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**
3. The app will run normally afterward

> The warning appears because the app is not code-signed. The program is safe; source code is on GitHub.
